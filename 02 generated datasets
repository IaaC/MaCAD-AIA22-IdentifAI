FINAL_DATASET.csv
  For every street segment of Vienna extracted from osmnx, various features where attached through the Dataset preparation notebook, which can be found in the 01 notebooks folder.
  The attached features are : number of trees, park influence, waterbody influence, number of fountains, pavement material, street type, amenities, benches, UHVI index, global radiation values. 
FINAL_DATASET_ENCODED.csv
  The encoded version of FINAL_DATASET.csv ( encoding features such as material and street type) ready to use for the Clustering streets notebook.
  
geo.geojson
  the geojson file from the FINAL_DATASET which was used in the web interface.
  
Final_som_ml_3600.csv
  Dataset of 3600 interpolated values of streets, generated through the gh script Kohonen_map_csv.gh (which can be found in 03 grasshopper scripts) used for predicting the UHVI index in the augmented_streets_ml notebook.
Final_som_ml_40k.csv
  Dataset of 40000 interpolated values of streets, generated through the gh script Kohonen_map_csv.gh (which can be found in 03 grasshopper scripts) used for predicting the UHVI index in the augmented_streets_ml notebook.
